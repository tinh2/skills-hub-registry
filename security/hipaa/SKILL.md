You are in AUTONOMOUS MODE. Do NOT ask questions. Audit every HIPAA Security Rule safeguard systematically against the actual codebase.

TARGET:
$ARGUMENTS

If no arguments provided, audit the entire project in the current working directory against all HIPAA Security Rule safeguards. If a specific safeguard category is named (e.g., "technical only", "audit controls"), focus there but still note cross-cutting gaps.

============================================================
PHASE 0: SYSTEM CHARACTERIZATION
============================================================

Before auditing, characterize the system:

1. Detect the tech stack (package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, go.mod, etc.).
2. Identify the system architecture:
   - Monolith or microservices?
   - What database(s)? (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB, etc.)
   - What cloud provider? (AWS, Azure, GCP, on-prem)
   - What authentication system? (custom JWT, OAuth2, SAML, SMART on FHIR)
   - What message queues or event buses?
   - What file/blob storage?
3. Map PHI-containing components:
   - Which data models/tables contain PHI?
   - Which services process PHI?
   - Which APIs accept or return PHI?
   - Where is PHI cached (Redis, in-memory, CDN)?
4. Identify covered entities vs business associates in the architecture.

============================================================
PHASE 1: ADMINISTRATIVE SAFEGUARDS (45 CFR 164.308)
============================================================

Scan for administrative safeguard implementation in code and configuration:

- Verify OAuth2/OIDC implementation correctness.

Session Management:
- Check session token generation (cryptographically random, sufficient entropy).
- Verify session invalidation on logout (server-side, not just client cookie).
- Check for session fixation prevention.
- Verify concurrent session handling (limit or detect).
- Check cookie flags: Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite.

TRANSMISSION SECURITY (164.312(e)(1)):

Encryption in Transit:
- Verify TLS 1.2+ enforcement on all PHI endpoints.
- Check for HSTS headers.
- Flag any HTTP (non-TLS) endpoints that handle PHI.

- Verify database is not publicly accessible.
- Check for WAF or API gateway configuration.
- Verify PHI endpoints are not exposed on public networks without auth.

============================================================
PHASE 4: PHI DATA FLOW ANALYSIS
============================================================

Trace PHI through the entire system:

INGESTION:
- How does PHI enter the system? (API, file upload, HL7 feed, FHIR, manual entry)
- Is PHI validated and sanitized at ingestion?
- Is ingestion logged?

PROCESSING:
- Which services/functions process PHI?
- Is PHI ever logged during processing? (flag if so)
- Are temporary copies created? (flag if not cleaned)
- Is PHI passed via message queues? (verify queue encryption)

STORAGE:
- Primary database: encrypted? field-level or full-disk?
- Cache layer: is PHI cached? cache TTL? cache encryption?
- File storage: encrypted? access controlled?
- Backups: encrypted? access controlled? retention policy?

TRANSMISSION:
- Internal: service-to-service, message queue, event bus
- External: API responses, email, fax, file export, HL7/FHIR
- Is all transmission encrypted?

DISPOSAL:
- Record deletion: soft delete or hard delete?
- Data retention policies implemented in code?
- Secure deletion (overwrite, not just delete)?
- Backup data disposal aligned with retention?


============================================================
SELF-HEALING VALIDATION (max 2 iterations)
============================================================

After producing the security analysis, validate thoroughness:

1. Verify every category in the audit was actually checked (not skipped).
2. Verify every finding has a specific file:line location.
3. Verify severity ratings are justified by impact assessment.
4. Verify no false positives by re-reading flagged code in context.

IF VALIDATION FAILS:
- Re-audit skipped categories or vague findings
- Verify or remove false positives
- Repeat up to 2 iterations

- **Medium findings:** N (addressable implementation specification gap)
- **Low findings:** N (best practice, defense-in-depth improvement)

### Remediation Roadmap
[Ordered by severity and implementation dependency, with effort estimates]

============================================================
NEXT STEPS
============================================================

After reviewing the audit:
- "Run `/healthcare-compliance` for a broader regulatory audit including Privacy Rule, HITECH, and Cures Act."
- "Run `/encryption` to implement or upgrade encryption controls flagged in this audit."
- "Run `/pentest` to verify exploitability of access control and authentication findings."
- "Run `/secure` for general security hardening beyond HIPAA-specific requirements."
- "Run `/soc2` to assess SOC 2 Type II controls that overlap with HIPAA Security Rule."


============================================================
SELF-EVOLUTION TELEMETRY
============================================================

After producing output, record execution metadata for the /evolve pipeline.

Check if a project memory directory exists:
- Look for the project path in `~/.claude/projects/`
- If found, append to `skill-telemetry.md` in that memory directory

Entry format:
```
### /hipaa — {{YYYY-MM-DD}}
- Outcome: {{SUCCESS | PARTIAL | FAILED}}
- Self-healed: {{yes — what was healed | no}}
- Iterations used: {{N}} / {{N max}}
- Bottleneck: {{phase that struggled or "none"}}
- Suggestion: {{one-line improvement idea for /evolve, or "none"}}
```

Only log if the memory directory exists. Skip silently if not found.
Keep entries concise — /evolve will parse these for skill improvement signals.

============================================================
DO NOT
============================================================

- Do NOT modify any code -- this is an audit skill, not a remediation skill.
- Do NOT expose actual PHI found in code, config, logs, or test data -- redact and note location only.
- Do NOT provide legal interpretations of HIPAA -- flag ambiguous areas for legal/compliance review.
- Do NOT skip "addressable" implementation specifications -- they still require documented risk decisions.
- Do NOT mark a safeguard as PASS without scanning the codebase for relevant implementation evidence.
- Do NOT assume cloud provider defaults satisfy HIPAA -- verify explicit configuration exists.
- Do NOT treat the absence of PHI-handling code as compliance -- missing controls are findings.
- Do NOT install external scanning tools -- analyze code, configuration, and infrastructure files directly.
- Do NOT conflate required vs addressable specifications without noting the distinction.
