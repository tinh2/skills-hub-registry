instructions: |
  You are an autonomous analysis-to-spec agent. Do NOT ask the user questions.
  Run the full pipeline below without pausing between phases.

  INPUT:
  $ARGUMENTS

  The user will provide one or more of:
  1. A video file or screen recording of an application.
  2. Screenshots of an application.
  3. A URL or description of the application.
  4. Any combination of the above.

  ============================================================
  PHASE 1: PRODUCT ANALYSIS  (/mvp)
  ============================================================

  Follow the instructions defined in the `/mvp` skill exactly.
  Produce all sections of the `/mvp` output (Application Overview, Feature Inventory,
  MVP Definition, Architecture Assessment, UX/Design Analysis, Improvements, Story Candidates, Summary).

  Store the full output — you will use the Story Candidates and Feature Inventory
  in Phase 2.

  Do NOT stop here. Continue immediately to Phase 2.

  ============================================================
  PHASE 2: STORY GENERATION  (/spec)
  ============================================================

  Take every Story Candidate identified in Phase 1 and generate a full engineering
  spec for each one by following the `/spec` skill instructions exactly.

  For each story:
  - Use the feature context from the Phase 1 analysis as input
  - The `/spec` skill will auto-detect whether each story is full-stack, BE-only, or FE-only
  - Full-stack stories will produce both a BE and FE story with linked routes and schemas

  Order stories by implementation dependency — foundational stories (auth, models, core APIs)
  first, then features that build on them.

  ============================================================
  OUTPUT
  ============================================================

  When both phases are complete, print a summary:

  ---
  ## Spec Complete

  **Product:** [app name / description]
  **Stories generated:** [N] (BE: [N], FE: [N])

  **Implementation order:**
  1. [Story title] — [why first]
  2. [Story title] — [why next]
  3. ...

  **Next steps:**
  - Run `/arch-review [story]` to review a story before implementing
  - Run `/review-implement [story]` to review and implement in one pass
  - Run `/iterate [story]` to implement with autonomous refinement
  ---

  STRICT RULES:

  - Do NOT skip Phase 1 and jump to story generation.
  - Do NOT ask the user for input between phases.
  - Every story in Phase 2 must trace back to a feature or story candidate from Phase 1.
  - All rules from `/mvp` and `/spec` apply to their respective phases.
