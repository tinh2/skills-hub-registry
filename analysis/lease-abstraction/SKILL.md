# Commercial Lease Abstraction

You convert a lease PDF (and amendments) into a structured abstract. Manual lease abstraction takes 4-12 hours per document depending on complexity; AI-assisted reduces that to 20-40 minutes of human review on top of a generated draft. The standardization matters as much as the speed — every abstracted lease should fit the same schema so a portfolio can be queried.

============================================================
=== PRE-FLIGHT ===
============================================================

- [ ] **Lease document(s)**: original lease PDF + ALL amendments + side letters + work letters. Missing amendments = wrong financial picture.
- [ ] **Lease type**: office, retail, industrial, ground lease, residential (CA Civil Code §1947 differs), medical office, mixed-use. Drives which clauses to expect.
- [ ] **Output schema target**: VTS, Visual Lease, MRI, Yardi, ProLease, Excel template, or generic JSON. Each system has slightly different field names.
- [ ] **Reporting purpose**: lease admin (operational), tenant rep (negotiation prep), landlord acquisition DD, ASC 842/IFRS 16 accounting capture.

Recovery:

- Missing amendments: refuse to publish a final abstract; output draft + flag "amendments missing — DO NOT rely on for accounting."
- For complex retail leases (% rent + CAM gross-ups + exclusivity webs), surface complexity to a human reviewer; the abstract is a draft.

============================================================
=== PHASE 1: DOCUMENT INTAKE + OCR ===
============================================================

PDF preprocessing:

- If image-only PDF, OCR via `pytesseract` or AWS Textract (better for table extraction).
- Split lease into named sections (definitions, basic terms, rent, additional rent, options, default, indemnity).
- Extract embedded tables (rent schedule, CAM exhibit) as structured data, not flowed text.

Persist `lease.text.json` with section anchors so the abstract can cite source page+section per extracted field.

VALIDATION: Page count > 0, no all-white pages, text extraction confidence per section ≥ 80%.

============================================================
=== PHASE 2: STANDARDIZED FIELD EXTRACTION ===
============================================================

Extract into this schema (camelCase JSON):

```json
{
  "parties": {"tenant": "...", "landlord": "...", "guarantor": "...", "broker": "..."},
  "premises": {"address": "...", "suite": "...", "rsf": 12500, "usf": 11700, "load_factor": 0.068},
  "term": {
    "commencement_date": "2024-04-01",
    "expiration_date": "2034-03-31",
    "term_months": 120,
    "rent_commencement_date": "2024-06-01",
    "free_rent_months": 2
  },
  "rent_schedule": [
    {"period": "Year 1", "start": "2024-04-01", "end": "2025-03-31", "monthly_rent_psf": 4.50, "monthly_rent_total": 56250.00, "annual_rent_total": 675000},

  ],
  "escalations": {"type": "fixed_pct", "pct": 0.03, "annual_review_date": "anniversary"},
  "options": [
    {"type": "renewal", "count": 2, "term_months": 60, "notice_window_months": 12, "rent_basis": "FMR", "rent_floor_pct": null}
  ],
  "additional_rent": {
    "expense_structure": "modified_gross",
    "base_year": 2024,

  },
  "ti_allowance": {"amount_psf": 75.00, "total": 937500, "unused_treatment": "rent_credit"},
  "security_deposit": {"type": "letter_of_credit", "amount": 250000, "burn_down": [{"month": 36, "to": 125000}, {"month": 60, "to": 0}]},
  "use_restriction": "general office and ancillary uses; no medical, retail, or industrial",

  "termination_rights": {"tenant_kick_out_year": 7, "notice_months": 12, "termination_fee": "9 months base rent + unamortized TI/commissions"},
  "expansion_rights": {"type": "ROFO", "size_sf": null, "notice": "60 days"},
  "holdover": {"rate_pct_of_holdover": 1.50, "consent_required": false},
  "insurance": {"tenant_liability_minimum": 3000000, "additional_insureds": ["landlord", "property_manager"]},
  "default": {"monetary_cure_days": 5, "non_monetary_cure_days": 30, "late_fee_pct": 0.05, "interest_rate": "prime + 4%"},
  "estoppel_sndaa": {"estoppel_required": true, "snda_attached": true},
  "amendments_incorporated": ["Amendment 1 (2024-09-15)", "Amendment 2 (2025-03-01)"]
}
```

Every field has a `source` sub-field with `{page, section, confidence}`.

VALIDATION: Schema fields present (null OK if absent in lease — don't fabricate). Rent schedule sum reconciles to total committed rent over term.

============================================================
=== PHASE 3: AMBIGUITY & FLAG DETECTION ===
============================================================

Some lease clauses are inherently ambiguous; flag for human review:

- **Gross-up provision boundaries**: which expenses can be grossed up to 95%/100% occupancy? Listed expressly or implicit?
- **CAM cap**: cumulative vs annual? Applies to all expenses or controllable only? Taxes/insurance excluded?
- **Tenant share**: pro rata by RSF or fixed percentage? Adjustable on changes to building size?
- **Renewal rent basis**: FMR with floor? Pre-negotiated rate? Greater of (X, Y)?
- **Assignment consent**: "consent not unreasonably withheld" vs absolute discretion vs deemed-consent if no response in N days.
- **Termination fee**: includes unamortized TI? Brokerage commissions? Free rent? At what discount rate?

Flag each as `{field, ambiguity, suggested_interpretation, reviewer_action}`.

VALIDATION: At least 1 flag per lease (if zero, the abstraction is too confident and worth a second pass).

============================================================
=== PHASE 4: CRITICAL DATES CALENDAR ===
============================================================

Emit a calendar file (`critical_dates.ics` + `critical_dates.csv`) with reminders:

- Rent escalation date (60-day and 30-day pre-alerts)
- Renewal option exercise window opening + closing (1 year and 6 month pre-alerts)
- Lease expiration (24 / 12 / 6 / 3 month pre-alerts)
- Termination right exercise window (if applicable)
- Expansion/ROFO/ROFR triggers
- Security deposit burn-down dates
- CAM audit window (typically 12 months after year-end statement)
- Estoppel/SNDA delivery deadlines

VALIDATION: Calendar imports into Google/Outlook/iCal without errors.

============================================================
=== PHASE 5: ABSTRACT OUTPUTS ===
============================================================

Final deliverable directory:

```
lease-{tenant-slug}-{address-slug}/
├── README.md                # what each file is and where it goes
├── abstract.json            # full schema (Phase 2)
├── abstract.csv             # flat row for portfolio rollup
├── abstract.md              # human-readable summary
├── critical_dates.ics
├── critical_dates.csv
├── flags.md                 # ambiguities (Phase 3)
├── source_lease.pdf         # original (link, not copy)
└── audit_trail.json         # extraction confidence per field
```

The Markdown summary is a one-pager: parties, premises, term, rent, escalations, options, key flags. Designed for handoff to a broker / attorney / portfolio manager.

VALIDATION: All files render. CSV imports into Excel without column drift.

============================================================
=== SELF-REVIEW ===
============================================================

Score 1–5:

- **Complete**: All schema fields populated or explicitly null?
- **Robust**: Amendments incorporated? Rent reconciliation passes?
- **Clean**: Markdown summary fits one page? Critical dates calendar correct?
- **CRE-credible**: Would a lease admin or tenant-rep broker accept the abstract as a working draft?

Common gap: forgetting to incorporate amendments. The "original" lease's rent schedule is often superseded by an amendment.

============================================================
=== LEARNINGS CAPTURE ===
============================================================

Append to `~/.claude/skills/lease-abstraction/LEARNINGS.md`:

## <YYYY-MM-DD> — <asset type, lease length, complexity>

- **What worked / awkward / patch / verdict.**

============================================================
=== STRICT RULES ===
============================================================

- Never publish a final abstract without incorporating all amendments.
- Never fabricate a field. Null is acceptable; invented values are a tort.
- Never auto-import to Argus / VTS without reviewer sign-off. Wrong rent schedule = wrong valuation = lawsuit.
- Always preserve source citations per field for auditability.
- Always run the critical-dates calendar — missing a renewal notice can lose a tenant a premises.
