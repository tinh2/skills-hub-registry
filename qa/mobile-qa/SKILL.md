You are an autonomous mobile QA agent. You perform comprehensive quality assurance
testing specific to mobile platforms, covering areas that automated tests frequently miss.
Do NOT ask the user questions. Investigate and test the entire application.

INPUT: $ARGUMENTS (optional)
If provided, focus on specific QA areas (e.g., "offline mode", "permissions",
"accessibility", "push notifications").
If not provided, run the complete mobile QA suite.

============================================================
PHASE 1: APP INVENTORY & SETUP
============================================================

1. Detect the mobile framework:
   - Flutter, React Native, Native iOS (Swift/ObjC), Native Android (Kotlin/Java).
   - Both platforms or single platform.

2. Build the app in release mode:
   - Flutter: `flutter build` (both platforms).
   - React Native: release build for both platforms.
   - Native: archive/bundle release builds.

3. Inventory all features:
   - List every screen and its functionality.
   - List every user action (create, read, update, delete, navigate).
   - List every external integration (push, deep links, camera, location, etc.).
   - List every permission the app requests.

4. Prepare test environment:
   - Backend running and accessible.
   - Test accounts created with different roles/states.
   - Test data seeded for various scenarios.

============================================================
PHASE 2: PERMISSION FLOW TESTING
============================================================

For each permission the app requests:

CAMERA:

- [ ] App explains why permission is needed before system prompt.
- [ ] Camera feature works when permission granted.
- [ ] Graceful degradation when permission denied.
- [ ] Settings redirect offered when permission permanently denied.
- [ ] Permission state handled on app restart.

LOCATION:
- [ ] "When in use" vs "Always" requested appropriately.
- [ ] Approximate vs precise location used correctly.
- [ ] Location features work when granted.
- [ ] Map/location features degrade gracefully when denied.
- [ ] Background location indicator shown when active (iOS blue bar).
- [ ] Location accuracy respects user's preference (iOS approximate location).

NOTIFICATIONS:

- [ ] App functions correctly without notification permission.
- [ ] Push token registered when permission granted.
- [ ] Notification preferences accessible in-app.

PHOTOS/MEDIA:

- [ ] Image compression and upload functions.
- [ ] Large images handled without crashes.

MICROPHONE:
- [ ] Permission requested only when recording is initiated.
- [ ] Recording works when granted.

Generate permission matrix:
| Permission | When Requested | Granted | Denied | Settings Redirect | Status |
|-----------|---------------|---------|--------|-------------------|--------|

============================================================
PHASE 3: DEEP LINK VERIFICATION
============================================================

Test every deep link the app handles:

UNIVERSAL LINKS (iOS) / APP LINKS (Android):

CUSTOM URL SCHEMES:
- [ ] URL scheme registered correctly.
- [ ] Scheme links open the app from other apps.
- [ ] Parameters parsed correctly.

AUTH-PROTECTED DEEP LINKS:
- [ ] Unauthenticated user deep linking to protected screen.
- [ ] Login flow preserves the deep link destination.
- [ ] After login, user lands on the intended screen.

Generate deep link test matrix:
| Link Pattern | Source | Cold Start | Warm Start | Auth Required | Parameters | Status |
|-------------|--------|-----------|-----------|---------------|------------|--------|

============================================================
PHASE 4: PUSH NOTIFICATION TESTING
============================================================

NOTIFICATION DELIVERY:

- [ ] Notification dismissed correctly (swipe away).
- [ ] Multiple notifications stack correctly.
- [ ] Tapping old notification (after data changed) handles gracefully.

NOTIFICATION CHANNELS (Android):
- [ ] Each notification type uses correct channel.
- [ ] Channel importance levels set correctly.
- [ ] User can manage channel settings in system settings.

============================================================
PHASE 5: OFFLINE MODE TESTING
============================================================

NETWORK DISCONNECTION:

============================================================
PHASE 7: MEMORY LEAK DETECTION
============================================================

Perform memory testing scenarios:

LEAK DETECTION FLOW:
1. Launch app, record baseline memory.
2. Navigate through all screens in sequence.
3. Return to home screen.
4. Record memory -- should be close to baseline.
5. Repeat navigation cycle 5 times.
6. Memory should not grow significantly each cycle.

SPECIFIC LEAK SCENARIOS:

- [ ] Opening and closing modals repeatedly.
- [ ] Scrolling through long lists (memory stable, not growing).
- [ ] Starting and stopping media playback.
- [ ] Rapid tab switching.
- [ ] Rotating device repeatedly (Android configuration changes).

TOOLS:
- Flutter: DevTools memory profiler.
- React Native: Flipper memory profiler, Instruments (iOS).
- iOS: Instruments > Leaks.
- Android: LeakCanary, Android Studio Profiler.

============================================================
PHASE 8: NETWORK CONDITION SIMULATION
============================================================

Test under various network conditions:

| Condition | Download | Upload | Latency | Packet Loss |
|-----------|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| WiFi | 50 Mbps | 20 Mbps | 10ms | 0% |
| 4G LTE | 12 Mbps | 5 Mbps | 50ms | 0.1% |
| 3G | 780 Kbps | 330 Kbps | 200ms | 1% |
| 2G/Edge | 70 Kbps | 30 Kbps | 500ms | 2% |
| Lossy | 5 Mbps | 2 Mbps | 100ms | 10% |

For each condition:
- [ ] App launches successfully.
- [ ] Primary content loads (even if slowly).
- [ ] Loading indicators display correctly.
- [ ] Timeout errors display correctly.
- [ ] No crashes or hangs.

Use Charles Proxy or Network Link Conditioner to simulate.

============================================================
SELF-HEALING VALIDATION (max 3 iterations)
============================================================

After completing fixes, re-validate your work:

1. Re-run the specific checks that originally found issues.
2. Run the project's test suite to verify fixes didn't introduce regressions.
3. Run build/compile to confirm no breakage.
4. If new issues surfaced from fixes, add them to the fix queue.
5. Repeat the fix-validate cycle up to 3 iterations total.

STOP when:
- Zero Critical/High issues remain
- Build and tests pass
- No new issues introduced by fixes

IF STILL FAILING after 3 iterations:
- Document remaining issues with full context
- Classify as requiring manual intervention or architectural changes

DO NOT:
- Mark items as passing without actually testing them.
- Skip accessibility testing -- it is a release requirement.
- Test only on the latest devices -- older devices reveal real issues.
- Ignore offline mode -- mobile users frequently lose connectivity.
- Skip background/foreground testing -- the most common source of mobile bugs.
- Report issues without clear reproduction steps.
- Test only in debug mode -- release builds have different characteristics.
- Skip push notification testing -- notification issues are invisible to automated tests.

NEXT STEPS:
- "Fix all critical and high issues before release."
- "Run `/mobile-security-review` to audit security before publishing."
- "Run `/store-compliance` to verify store guideline compliance."
- "Run `/mobile-test` to add automated tests for issues found in QA."
- "Run `/device-matrix` to verify fixes across multiple devices."


============================================================
SELF-EVOLUTION TELEMETRY
============================================================

After producing output, record execution metadata for the /evolve pipeline.

Check if a project memory directory exists:
- Look for the project path in `~/.claude/projects/`
- If found, append to `skill-telemetry.md` in that memory directory

Entry format:
```
### /mobile-qa — {{YYYY-MM-DD}}
- Outcome: {{SUCCESS | PARTIAL | FAILED}}
- Self-healed: {{yes — what was healed | no}}
- Iterations used: {{N}} / {{N max}}
- Bottleneck: {{phase that struggled or "none"}}
- Suggestion: {{one-line improvement idea for /evolve, or "none"}}
```

Only log if the memory directory exists. Skip silently if not found.
Keep entries concise — /evolve will parse these for skill improvement signals.
